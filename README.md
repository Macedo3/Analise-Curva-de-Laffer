## 📜 Description

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the potential existence of a Laffer Curve in the current economic scenario of Brazil. The Laffer Curve represents the relationship between tax rates and government revenue, suggesting that there exists an optimal tax rate beyond which further increases may lead to diminishing returns.

Using Python programming language and leveraging various data analysis techniques, this project will delve into the intricate dynamics of tax policies and their impact on government revenue in the Brazilian context. It will involve collecting, processing, and analyzing relevant economic data to identify trends, correlations, and potential inflection points where increased tax rates may result in decreased revenue.

The key steps of the project will include:

- 1° Data Collection: Gathering pertinent economic data including tax rates, government revenue, and other relevant variables over a specified time period.

- 2° Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the collected data for analysis, including handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.

- 3° Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting a thorough examination of the data to uncover patterns, correlations, and any initial insights regarding the relationship between tax rates and government revenue.

- 4° Visualization: Creating informative charts, graphs, and visualizations to present the findings in an understandable and compelling manner.

- 5° Interpretation and Conclusion: Analyzing the results obtained from the model and drawing conclusions regarding the existence and characteristics of the Laffer Curve in the Brazilian context.

The insights gained from this analysis will provide valuable information for policymakers and economists in understanding the potential consequences of tax policy adjustments. By shedding light on the complex interplay between tax rates and government revenue, this project aims to contribute to informed decision-making in economic policy.
